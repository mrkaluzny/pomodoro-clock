# Pomodoro Clock
The **Pomodoro Technique** is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.[1] The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are named pomodoros, the plural in English of the Italian word pomodoro (tomato), after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student. The method is based on the idea that frequent breaks can improve mental agility.

## Task: Build a pomodoro clock
### Rules, Objectives & User Stories
Those are the rules, objectives & User Stories from the Free Code Camp Course, and the whole project is available at this [website](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-pomodoro-clock).
- Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to [this](https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/aNyxXR/).
- Rule #1: Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.
- Rule #2: Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.
